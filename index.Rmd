# Preamble

```{r, echo = FALSE}
options(bitmapType="cairo")

```

The aim of the [R for Mass
Spectrometry](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) initiative is to
provide efficient, thoroughly documented, tested and flexible R
software for the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass
spectrometry assays, including proteomics and metabolomics
experiments. The project formalises the longtime collaborative
development efforts of its core members under the RforMassSpectrometry
organisation to facilitate dissemination and accessibility of their
work.

```

This material introduces participants to the analysis and exploration
of mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics data using R and
Bioconductor. The course will cover all levels of MS data, from raw
data to identification and quantitation data, up to the statistical
interpretation of a typical shotgun MS experiment and will focus on
hands-on tutorials. At the end of this course, the participants will
be able to manipulate MS data in R and use existing packages for their
exploratory and statistical proteomics data analysis.

## Targeted audience and assumed background  {-}

The course material is targeted to either proteomics practitioners or
data analysts/bioinformaticians that would like to learn how to use R
and Bioconductor to analyse proteomics data. Familiarity with MS or
proteomics in general is desirable, but not essential as we will walk
through and describe a typical MS data as part of learning about the
tools. A working knowledge of R (R syntax, commonly used functions,
basic data structures such as data frames, vectors, matrices, ... and
their manipulation) is required. Familiarity with other Bioconductor
omics data classes and the tidyverse syntax is useful, but not
necessary.


```{r bib, include=FALSE}
# create a bib file for the R packages used in this document
knitr::write_bib(c('base', 'rmarkdown', 'bookdown', 'msmbstyle'), file = 'skeleton.bib')
```

```{r env_0, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("BiocStyle"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("mzR"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("Spectra"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("QFeatures"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("MsCoreUtils"))
```

## Setup {-}

This material uses the latest version of the R for Mass Spectrometry
package and their dependencies. It might this be possible that even
the latest Bioconductor stable version aren't recent enough.

To install the latest versions of all the package, please use R
version 4.2 and execute:

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("msdata")
BiocManager::install("mzR")
BiocManager::install("rhdf5")
BiocManager::install("rpx")
BiocManager::install("MsCoreUtils")
BiocManager::install("QFeatures")
BiocManager::install("Spectra")
BiocManager::install("ProtGenerics")
BiocManager::install("PSMatch")
BiocManager::install("pheatmap")
BiocManager::install("RforMassSpectrometry/SpectraVis")
```

To compile and render the teaching material, you will also need the
(slighly modified) [Modern Statistics for Model Biology (msmb) HTML
Book Style](https://www-huber.embl.de/users/msmith/msmbstyle/) by Mike
Smith:

```{r setup2, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("lgatto/msmbstyle")
```
